                    Hello World! My name is Chase Quigley. I am a computer science major enrolled at the University of Massachusetts Boston.
                    I am currently in my sophomore year with an expected graduation of May 2026. Outside of school I work as a technology specialist
                    at Genesis of Braintree.

                <p id="info-text">
                    Some of my skills include, but are not limited to: C, C#, Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Swift, SwiftUI, Python,
                    Bash, Linux, Data Structures & Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming, Data Analytics, Excel, Sheets, Teamwork, and Customer Satisfaction.

                <hr class="line">
                <pre id="info-text">
Relevant courses I have taken so far: 
        CS 110 - An introductoty course teaching the basics of computing. Taught in Python.

        CS 210 - The first introduction into data structures and algorithms. Taught in Java.

        CS 220 - Discrete mathematics course which introduced concepts relevant to computer science such as 
                       big O notation, algorithm design, and logic gates.

        CS 240 -  This course introduced the C lanuage as a way to introduce students into the idea behind memory and pointers. Taught in C.

        CS 310 - A course building upon CS210, introduced new algorithms, data structures, as well as a broader view on 
                       algorithmic performance. Taught in *student preference*.

        CS 341 -  A course which dives into computers as embedded systems, assembly language, and interactions between computers. 
                       Taught in C and assembly.
